# Assassination-Game

So, I've been learning to code for about a year now, and this is what I've learned so far from working on this for about two months. It's a simple, open-source game where you play as a hitman who needs to eliminate three targets. 

This game requires PySimpleGUI, Pygame, and Pyperclip for it to properly run. It's completely open-source, so feel free to modify this code as you see fit. Right now, I'm stumped on what I should do about the third target; I look forward to seeing what you guys might come up with. 

In the meantime, I'll be updating this accordingly. Feel free to share feedback or inform me of any issues you might run into. Cheers!
